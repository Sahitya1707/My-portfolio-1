  I'm sahitya neupane, and i design websites. While i'm based in Nepal. I help build websites for people all over the world.

  I define myself by the work I want to do.I am now pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science and
          information technology (CSIT). I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself. I realized learning web developement would be the perfect fit. I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code.

          I'm a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and juggle different projects and roles with relative ease.I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. You can read more about myself in the pdf attached below:
